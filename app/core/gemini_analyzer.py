            **Types of flashcards to create**:
            1. **Definition Cards** (6-8 cards): Key terms and their precise definitions
            2. **Concept Cards** (4-5 cards): Important concepts and explanations  
            3. **Process Cards** (2-3 cards): Steps, procedures, or methodologies
            4. **Comparison Cards** (2-3 cards): Contrasting ideas or approaches
            5. **Application Cards** (2-3 cards): Examples and real-world applications

            **Quality Standards**:
            - FRONT: Clear, specific question or term that tests understanding
            - BACK: Complete but concise answer (2-4 sentences maximum)
            - Avoid yes/no questions - use "What is...?", "How does...?", "Why...?"
            - Test one focused concept per card
            - Use active recall principles for maximum learning effectiveness
            - Include context when helpful for understanding
